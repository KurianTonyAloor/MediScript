I want you to build a complete Android app called MedScript, using Java or Kotlin (your choice), in Android Studio.

ðŸ“± Purpose:

The app allows doctors to fill out a prescription form, save it as a PDF, and include a signature image at the bottom-right. The PDF layout should match the structure of a sample I've uploaded (or use the structure below).

âœ… Core Functional Requirements:

Doctor Info (Stored Locally)
One-time form to enter:

Name

Degree (e.g., MBBS)

Registration Number

Phone Number

Hospital/Clinic Name

Address

Store this info using SharedPreferences

Editable via a "Doctor Info" settings screen

This info will be used in every PDF generated

Patient Prescription Form
Fields required:

Name

DOB (auto-calculate age)

Gender (dropdown)

Mobile Number

Address

Height + unit

Weight + unit

Chief Complaint

Diagnosis

Notes

Follow-up date + time (datetime picker)

Drug entries (see below)

Drug Entry System
Allow adding one or more drugs:

Drug Name

Strength

Dose

Route

Frequency

Duration

Quantity

Instructions

Each drug should be listed on the PDF neatly.

PDF Generation
Generate a PDF using PdfDocument or any preferred library

Must include:

Doctor's info at the top

Patient + diagnosis + drug list in the middle

Follow-up date

Doctorâ€™s signature image (PNG) aligned to the bottom right

Save the PDF to device storage (e.g., /Documents/ folder)

Optionally: open/share the PDF

Doctor Signature Upload
Add a screen to upload or capture a doctorâ€™s signature

Store the PNG locally (e.g., in internal storage)

This PNG is inserted at the bottom-right corner of the generated PDF

ðŸ“¦ Project Structure Suggestions:

MainActivity.java â€“ patient form and drug list

DoctorInfoActivity.java â€“ edit/view doctor info

AddDrugActivity.java â€“ dialog to add drug

PDFGenerator.java â€“ handles PDF layout + export

Models: Prescription.java, Drug.java

Utility: DoctorInfoManager.java (for SharedPreferences)

ðŸ§¾ Sample Layout (PDF Output Template):

yaml

âœ¨ Optional Enhancements (if time allows):

Add history tab to view past prescriptions

Enable dark mode compatibility

Add app icon and splash screen

Please build the app as a full Android Studio project, include all layouts, models, and permission handling (especially for file storage on Android 10+). Export a signed or debug APK if possible, and include instructions to run it.

Add an added utility to generate a code embedded in a qr that is placed in the bottom left corner of the prescription. The codes generated and the corresponding prescription data should be saved locally, for later verification. There should be an option to scan and verify a given prescription for this code to verify if it was generated by the app, for added security the info from the prescription should be displayed in app for verification.

The app should be constructed in kotlin, to make an app that is completely run in the phone as a simple apk
